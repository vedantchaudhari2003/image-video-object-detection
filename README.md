- YOLO
- SSD
- Faster R-CNN

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-video-object-detection.git
    ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data` folder.
2. Run the training script for the selected algorithm:
    ```bash
    python train_yolo.py
    ```
3. Use the trained model to detect objects in an image or video:
    ```bash
    python detect.py --source path_to_image_or_video
    ```

## Results
The object detection models demonstrated high accuracy and robustness across various test scenarios, showing significant improvement in detection rates.
